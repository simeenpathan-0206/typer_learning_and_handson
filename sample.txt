Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that operate as autonomous agents capable of making decisions, taking actions, and collaborating with other agents or humans to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI models that simply respond to queries, agentic AI frameworks integrate reasoning, planning, and adaptability. These agents can orchestrate workflows, interact with structured and unstructured data sources, and dynamically adjust strategies based on context. Common applications include multi-agent systems for enterprise automation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for knowledge retrieval, and orchestrators that manage specialized agents like data processors, document analyzers, and summarizers. The ultimate aim of agentic AI is to create intelligent ecosystems where agents work together seamlessly to deliver accurate, context-aware solutions.
